## Reflection

PC assembly lab is the first lab I underwent in UTM. First of all, it allowed me to learn the hardware components of a PC by physically interacting. I could identify the components and functions such as the power supply, RAM, and ROM after the lab. Besides, it enhanced my problem-solving skills and I gained experience in facing challenges as we had to assemble the PC on our own after the dissemble guided by a lab assistant. We had to troubleshoot if the PC did not work. Lastly, as we were allocated in groups, I got the opportunity to work with classmates. I realized that effective communication is crucial in teamwork.
