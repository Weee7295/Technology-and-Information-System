## Reflection

Before visiting UTM Digital, we had a virtual talk to preview the key areas and roles. We visited 5 places which are the open office, data center, digital care unit, and TM room. UTM Digital serves as our university driver to upgrade ICT services to the latest technology and ensure the ICT infrastructure is always available to support the system. Overall, I appreciate every staff for keeping our university running. Their dedication and hard work inspired me. I admire their profession and look forward to learning from them
