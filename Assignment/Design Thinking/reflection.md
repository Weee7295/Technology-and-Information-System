## Reflection

Design thinking provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. I learned how to create a product that meets the needs of users. It is not just my idea to innovate something, but have to relate to users' demands and solve the problems. By testing the prototype, I understood the importance of refinement to ensure our solutions were user-friendly and effective. Design thinking encourages me to think creatively and develop solutions to problems which are somehow similar to the software development life cycle.
