## Reflection
This industrial talk with I-Farm  broadened my understanding of technologies in agriculture. They do a combination of technologies in agriculture which are vertical farming and hydroponics farming with IoT applications, machine learning and cloud computing. I realized that technology did help to improve the living quality of human. It also inspired me to explore technology out of school.
