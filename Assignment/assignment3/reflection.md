## Reflection

From this industrial talk, the speaker shared how she got into this field and became a member of Credence. It got me thinking of my journey to be a future system developer in the next 4 years throughout university life. It is essential to learn a variety of programming languages such as Python and Java as it is the fundamental skills for a system developer. Besides, I should improve my soft skills such as analysis, problem-solving, and critical thinking as those are indispensable skills for a system developer to meet clients' demands. I plan to join projects and workshops available at the university to enhance my soft skills. During my leisure time, I will do some self-study to have a better understanding of basic computer science principles, including data structures, algorithms, and programming languages
