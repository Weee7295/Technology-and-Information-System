## Reflection

I have an understanding of 5 distinct ICT careers which are Web Developer, UI/UX Designer, Android Developer, and QA Testing Analyst after the talk. Those speakers shared about the difference between work-life and study which made me realize the importance of adaptability in the workplace. The talk also outlined essential skills in each career, emphasizing not only technical skills but also soft skills such as communication skills and problem-solving skills.
