Reflection :
PC assembly lab is the first lab I underwent in UTM. 
First of all,  it allowed me to learn the hardware components of a PC by physically interacting. 
I could identify the components and functions such as the power supply, RAM, and ROM after 
the lab. Besides, it enhanced my problem-solving skills and I gained experience in facing challenges 
as we had to assemble the PC on our own after the dissemble guided by a lab assistant. We had to 
troubleshoot if the PC did not work. Lastly, as we were allocated in groups, I got the 
opportunity to work with classmates. I realized that effective communication is crucial in  Teamwork.
